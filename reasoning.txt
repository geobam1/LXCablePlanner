Reasoning on rules alignment

1) Observed mismatch between documents and actual environment — Codex
- clauderules.md claims Claude has direct local system access and can edit files/run commands without sandboxing, while Codex is positioned as IDE/autocomplete/sandboxed execution. — Codex
- In this actual session, Codex CLI is the tool with local filesystem access and command execution (subject to sandbox/approvals). That makes the current descriptions inaccurate for this repo's real workflow. — Codex

2) Inconsistencies between clauderules.md and codexrules.md — Codex
- The two files are now aligned with each other but both are aligned to an environment that does not match this one. — Codex
- codexrules.md defers direct file edits and local command execution to Claude, which contradicts how tasks are executed here. — Codex

3) Impact of the mismatch — Codex
- These rules would cause the wrong tool to be chosen for tasks like edits, git operations, or local verification in this environment. — Codex
- That increases friction because it directs work away from the tool actually performing local changes. — Codex

4) Recommended direction — Codex
- If the intent is to describe this repo’s real workflow, update both files to reflect that Codex performs local file edits and command execution here. — Codex
- Reserve Claude for planning, review, long-form reasoning, and broader context tasks. — Codex

5) Next step — Codex
- Await your confirmation to update both rule files so they describe real usage rather than IDE/Copilot and remote/sandboxed assumptions. — Codex
